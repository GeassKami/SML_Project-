Effectiveness of diabetic treatments based on readmission of patient!

As per International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 3820 million people live with diabetes globally, and this number is expected to double in the next 15 years.
To Evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments to lower the impact of diabetes, it is essential to find readmission rate of diabetic patients is crucial to know the effectiveness of the treatment
The objective is to use different machine learning models to predict the patient's readmission based on different parameters present in the dataset.
This will provide the service in recognition of the effectiveness of diabetic treatments for patients.
